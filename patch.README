To install this patch you have to concatenate the text from build.xml.patch.xml too the old build.xml.
If you did not changed anything in Compiler.java in assignment 1, it should be ok to just overwrite the old Compiler.java with the new one.

If you do this the run target from assignment 1 will be broken because of the constructor in Compiler.java.
It is not required that this target work and you can either safely remove the target, fix the target or simply ignore it.

The rest of the files should be easely added in.
